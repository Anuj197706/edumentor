Since mₐ ≈ 4mₚ and mₚ ≈ 1836mₑ, we compare √(16mₑE), √(4mₚE), and √(mₐE) = √(4mₚE). So λₚ ≈ λₐ. Let\'s check the numbers. √(16mₑE) ≈ 4√mₑ√E. √(4mₚE) = 2√mₚ√E ≈ 2√(1836mₑ)√E ≈ 85√mₑ√E. √(4mₚE) is the same. So λₑ > λₚ ≈ λₐ. This contradicts the given answer. Let\'s re-read. Ah, I made a mistake. The terms are in the denominator. λₑ ∝ 1/(4√mₑ). λₚ ∝ 1/(2√mₚ). λₐ ∝ 1/(√mₐ) = 1/(2√mₚ). So λₚ = λₐ. And since mₚ > mₑ, √mₚ > √mₑ, so 1/√mₚ < 1/√mₑ. Comparing λₑ and λₚ: 1/(4√mₑ) vs 1/(2√mₚ) = 1/(2 * 42.8√mₑ) = 1/(85.6√mₑ). Thus λₑ > λₚ. The order is λₑ > λₚ = λₐ. The provided answer is likely a simplification.' },
