Wait, O₂ (paramagnetic) -> O₂⁺ (paramagnetic), magnetic behavior is unchanged. NO (paramagnetic) -> NO⁺ (diamagnetic), magnetic behavior changes and bond order increases. Let me recheck O2. O2 has 2 unpaired e-. O2+ has 1 unpaired e-. So it is still paramagnetic. Let\'s check option D. NO has one unpaired electron in π* orbital, so it is paramagnetic. NO+ is isoelectronic with N₂, so it is diamagnetic. The bond order of NO is 2.5, and for NO+ it is 3. So both conditions are met for D. Let me re-read the question and options. Ah, option A. O₂ -> O₂⁺. BO increases from 2 to 2.5. O₂ is paramagnetic. O₂⁺ is also paramagnetic. So the magnetic behavior does not change. The question is flawed or I misinterpret "changed". Let\'s assume it means from paramagnetic to diamagnetic or vice versa. Then NO -> NO⁺ is the correct answer. Let\'s reconsider O₂ -> O₂⁺. Maybe the number of unpaired electrons changing is considered a change in magnetic behavior. If so, O₂ has 2, O₂⁺ has 1. That is a change. Let\'s go with the most distinct change, which is from paramagnetic to diamagnetic. The best answer is NO -> NO⁺.'},
